# Automatic-Plant-irrigation-system
In this project Created a 4-wheel drive plant watering robot controlled by mobile with
the help Bluetooth module and uses a servo motor to make the sensor movable.

Introduction
In Metro cities mostly people wants a balcony garden in there flats but due to their
jobs they canâ€™t take care of the garden so our project that is automatic plant irrigation 
system will help them to maintain the garden & this project will work as a lung for your flat.


Components used -
1-Arduino UNO
2-5V Single Channel Relay Module
3-5V DC Motor & Pipe
4-Jumpe Cable
5-Battery 5 Volt
6-Moisture Sensor

In this system, soil moisture sensor senses the moisture level of the soil. If soil will get
dry then sensor senses low moisture level and automatically switches on the water pump to supply 
water to the plant. As plant get sufficient water and soil get wet then sensor senses enough moisture in soil.
After which the water pump will automatically get stopped.
